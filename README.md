# filter-project

3-shade color filter (simplifies photo into 3 shades)
a) type in a url of an online-sourced photo, or use one of the provided locally sourced photos
b) choose a color to load the image with the filter

Boundary cases: photos with low contrast; exceptionally light/dark photos Application limits: photos sourced from websites that will not allow reuploading (CORS policy), unreasonably large photos
